#
* colorized output from shell
* multi-threading with rust
* hyper http request

notes:
* leading underscore in variable name would skip unused variable check


阅读顺序:
* main
* benchmark:
* expandable: 主要是解析 yaml 文件中的 item 到 &mut list 上
* actions
  * assign: excute 方法主要是去执行 assign, 将变量设置到 context hashmap 上
  * request: excute 方法主要是去执行 http request


# Drill

Drill is a HTTP load testing application written in Rust. The main goal
for this project is to build a really lightweight tool as alternative to other
that require JVM and other stuff.

You can write brenchmark files, in YAML format, describing all the stuff you
want to test.

It was inspired by [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_intro.html)
syntax because it is really easy to use and extend.

Here is an example for **benchmark.yml**:

```yaml
---

threads: 4
base: 'http://localhost:9000'
iterations: 5

plan:
  - name: Include comments
    include: comments.yml

  - name: Fetch users
    request:
      url: /api/users.json

  - name: Fetch organizations
    request:
      url: /api/organizations

  - name: Fetch account
    request:
      url: /api/account
    assign: foo

  - name: Fetch manager user
    request:
      url: /api/users/{{ foo.manager_id }}

  - name: Assign values
    assign:
      key: bar
      value: "2"

  - name: Fetch user from assign
    request:
      url: /api/users/{{ bar }}

  - name: Fetch some users
    request:
      url: /api/users/{{ item }}
    with_items:
      - 70
      - 73
      - 75

  - name: Fetch some users by hash
    request:
      url: /api/users/{{ item.id }}
    with_items:
      - { id: 70 }
      - { id: 73 }
      - { id: 75 }

  - name: Fetch some users from CSV
    request:
      url: /api/users/contacts/{{ item.id }}
    with_items_from_csv: ./fixtures/users.csv

  - name: Fetch no relative url
    request:
      url: http://localhost:9000/api/users.json
```

As you can see you can play with interpolations in different ways. This
will let you specify a benchmank with different requests and
dependencies between them.

## Install

The easiest way right now is to download the source code and compile
it:

```
git clone git@github.com:fcsonline/drill.git && cd drill
cargo build --release
./target/release/drill --benchmark benchmark.yml
```

## Test it

Go to the `example` directorty and you'll find a [README](./example) how
to test it in a safe environment.

**Disclaimer**: We really recommend not to run intensive benchmanks against
production environments.

## Command line interface

Full list of cli options, which is available under `drill --help`

```
drill 0.1.0
HTTP load testing application written in Rust inspired by Ansible syntax

USAGE:
    drill [OPTIONS] --benchmark <benchmark>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help       Prints help information
    -V, --version    Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -b, --benchmark <benchmark>    Sets the benchmark file
    -c, --compare <compare>        Sets a compare file
    -r, --report <report>          Sets a report file
    -t, --threshold <threshold>    Sets a threshold value in ms amongst the compared file

```

## Roadmap

- Complete and improve the interpolation engine
- Add cookie support
- Add writing to a file support
- Add statistic support

## Contribute

This project started as a side project to learn Rust, so I'm sure that is full
of mistakes and areas to be improve. If you think you can tweak the code to
make it better, I'll really appreaciate a pull request. ;)
